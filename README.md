## Hi there 👋

I'm Neel, a programmer from the UK

I (try to) code whatever I can imagine into existance

If I think of an idea, chances are I will go through with it (bonus: if it looks cool)

My main tech stack is React, Django, PostgreSQL which I have grown to enjoy

I have some projects on my page you can have a look at and feel free to improve on them
